You can run php artisan migrate:rollback command and if a table was created in a last batch, it will be deleted (if down() method of a migration was written correctly, of course).

If not, you can create a new migration and delete table with drop() method:

Schema::drop('users');
Or:

Schema::dropIfExists('users');
